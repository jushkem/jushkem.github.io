"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." - Steve Jobs, Founder of Apple
"The world is not black or white, but a delicious shade of grey." - Camille, League of Legends
"개구리 올챙이 적 생각도 못 한다. Translation: A frog forgets when he was once a tadpole." - Korean proverb
